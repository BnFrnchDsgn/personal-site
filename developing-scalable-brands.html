        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Why do designers care about scalable brands?</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">All brands, big and small, rely on combining different elements to create an
                overarching brand identity. These elements could be as simple as a logo or as complex as a
                communications strategy document.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Scalability refers to how efficiently a brand can add or remove these elements
                depending on emerging opportunities & challenges.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">For designers, scalability is an opportunity to plan ahead for success. The more
                adaptive a brand is, the easier it will be to capitalize on future opportunities or avoid significant
                issues.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brand designers strive to deliver the most value possible for the brands they work
                on or with. Their ability to incorporate scalability has a significant effect on this value.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Accounting for brand scalability involves understanding brand elements, when changes
                occur, and how change adoption occurs.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sectionImageCaption">

        <div class="imageCaption">
            <p>
                People change constantly, and as a result there is a consistent audience pressure on brands to stay relatable.

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Understanding brand responsiveness and scalability</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Societal and economic changes happen regularly in every industry, which affects how
                brands are perceived by different audiences. What might be popular last year, may no longer be
                appropriate due to social change — affecting brands that haven't adapted to these changes.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brands that act on these changes, either in direct response to or in preparation of,
                use responsiveness to adapt.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">To enable responsive capabilities, brands benefit from being well organized to
                account for potential changes. Scalability is how well a brand has been planned and organized, enabling
                a variety of responsive functionality to keep it as relevant as possible.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brand designers look for missed scalability opportunities, which can be resolved by
                either providing new documentation, planning, or assets. These types of elements are combined to form
                parts of or even entire brands.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Having these elements, brand designers can strategize what types of changes a brand
                might need to respond to. These changes can come from a variety of sources, such as market trends,
                organization growth, and business goals.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">The final aspect of scalability involves directing how a brand will communicate with
                its stakeholders during these changes. Some events require significant changes to a brand, which can be
                challenging for many organizations when not prepared.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Together, all of these different considerations fit together as part of a scalable
                brand direction.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="sectionLearnEntry">
        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Exploring the different types of brand elements</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brand designers use different elements when composing a brand. Some common element
                examples include logos, style guides, and office stationary.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">To define and categorize these elements, they can be grouped in the following
                categories:</p>
            <ul class="scrollEaseIn">
                <li>Visuals</li>
                <li>Guides</li>
                <li>Strategies</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This categorization allows brand designers to quickly sort through possible elements
                depending on the brand they're developing.</p>

            <h3 class="scrollEaseIn">Visuals</h3>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnIndent">These are visual elements including graphics, physical materials, and digital
                graphic assets. Visuals are typically the most front-facing elements in a brand and are used together to
                visually represent brand values. Properties like colour and style are often used to differentiate the
                visual assets that belong to one brand from another.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnIndent">Logos and brandmarks are the most well known visual elements, serving as a
                simplified representation of an entire brand.</p>

            <h3 class="scrollEaseIn">Guides</h3>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnIndent">These are supporting elements exclusively reserved for stakeholders that work under
                or with a brand, which explain how parts of the brand function.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnIndent">Guides are an incredibly important resource for brands to use internally, empowering
                the members of an organization to work consistently by following a defined approach. This adds
                predictability to a brand, helping teams work consistently regardless of how large an organization is.
            </p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnIndent">Style and messaging guides are common elements used in many organizations that
                provide useful references for teams when working with brand assets.</p>

            <h3 class="scrollEaseIn">Strategies</h3>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnIndent">These are planning elements that provide insight into the knowledge of a brand.
                Strategy elements focus on explaining the logic behind brand decisions, rather than how to complete
                tasks.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnIndent">Strategies are affirmations of what a brand represents, stating clear goals &
                expectations to direct internal conversations about how a brand changes over time. Incorporating
                strategies into brand discussions reduces uncertainty when considering the effects of changes to a
                brand.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnIndent">Most strategy elements are documents that explain how a brand seeks to manage
                stakeholders, market position, and internal workflows.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sectionImageCaption">

                Branding is ultimately a 'bucket' term used to describe a number of elements that all fit together as part of creating a marketed identity.

    <div class="sectionLearnEntry">
        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">When and why brands change</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brand perception is affected by a variety of factors, from social norms to market
                trends & disruptions. Perception is a fundamental component of brands, and is typically the main
                consideration behind most brand decisions.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">However, brand perception differs depending on the individual interacting with a
                brand. By organizing individuals into groups by similarity called stakeholders, brand designers can more
                easily account for these perception differences.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">As changes in society, economies, and technology emerge — those affected begin to
                adjust their lifestyles and behaviours accordingly. What might have been convenient previously may no
                longer be possible due to change in a market.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">When the individuals that compose stakeholder groups begin to change, so must brands
                in order to be as relevant as possible to their stakeholders.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">For example, increased usage of mobile devices for web browsing over time has
                affected the ways that many individuals use websites. These behavioural changes then affect how well
                site visitors comprehend information that may have been originally designed for desktop audiences.
                Brands that want to adapt to these behaviour changes may want to introduce new internal guides for
                developing mobile-friendly content.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brands that change slowly or not at all, will often see reduced engagement due to a
                lack of relevancy by their stakeholders.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">How fast a brand can change is influenced by factors like the volume of elements
                used, amount of stakeholders, and organization of assets. Brand designers will refer to design
                disciplines like Information Architecture and Information Design to help ensure those working with or
                under a brand can contribute to changes as efficiently as possible.</p>

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Stakeholder adoption to brand changes</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">An ongoing challenge for many brands involves getting stakeholders to adopt new
                changes. The longer individuals interact with brands, the more comfortable they are with the status quo.
            </p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Even when aspects of a brand become less relevant, stakeholders may still anchor on
                to a perception that affects their willingness to accept a new perception.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">For example, a local hardware store identifies that a significant number of their
                customers prefer to shop online. The store is primarily known to offer in-store shopping experiences,
                and has no digital presence. After deploying a new online store, the store staff notice that most of
                their customers continue to visit the physical location, despite the option of shopping online.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">In this example, the risks are not immediately apparent, but the store staff
                identify a need for their brand to adapt to new customer behaviours. The main risk they likely
                anticipate involves customer drop-off due to a lack of convenient shopping methods, which guides the
                decision to deploy an online store.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">However, despite acting appropriately, the store staff fail to see their customer
                stakeholders adopt this new brand change.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Stakeholder adoption to brand changes requires a concentrated effort from a brand to
                alter the perception a stakeholder group has of a brand. This means putting forward communication that
                clearly identifies what the change is and how it benefits stakeholders.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">Continuing the previous example, the store staff launch an in-store & digital
                awareness campaign that alerts shoppers to the availability of their new online store. In this
                communication, they highlight numerous customer advantages that involve convenience, promotions, and
                speed. Over time, store staff see an increase in online store activity, which gradually reaches a point
                where overall sales have increased. Store staff conduct more customer surveys to learn that the added
                benefits to shoppers have increased the amount of transactions they make with the store on a regular
                basis.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brand designers look for opportunities to improve the communication between
                stakeholder groups. Often, this involves equipping organizations with both the knowledge and tools to
                inform other stakeholders of how necessary changes will provide new benefits.</p>

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Taking a proactive approach to change</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Many brands rely on reactionary approaches to change, where inaction causes issues
                if changes aren't made. Although being responsive to perception changes is important, it is equally if
                not more important to consider the proactive aspects of scalability.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brand designers evaluate where parts of a brand may need to change most frequently
                and where a brand may take longer to change. This analysis provides insights into determining when
                brands may want to start embracing change, and how an organization can take the steps to enact this
                change efficiently.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Scalability for brands is a proactive consideration, where dedicated efforts are
                made to ensure brand changes are well-planned, completed efficiently, and widely adopted.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Not every brand requires a brand designer or team to manage its evolution over time,
                but every brand should be mindful of its scalability. Are assets and resources easy to access? How are
                stakeholders informed of changes? Are there varying opinions on brand values?</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brand designers taking a proactive approach to brand development will strive to
                mitigate risks affecting how efficient brands can adapt to change.</p>

                Many teams engage in regular brainstorming sessions to help keep a brand moving in the most appropriate direction.

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">The underlying benefits of scalable brands</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Every organization seeks to empower their teams to take the most efficient actions
                possible. Reducing obstacles to opportunities results in benefits for both the organization members and
                other stakeholder groups.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">Having the resources and capability to remain relevant consistently over time
                contributes to higher engagement from stakeholders. For example, an apparel brand that always appears to
                offer trending options will always succeed in maintaining and growing a customer base. Or, a technology
                company that supplies their staff with the most up-to-date devices to support their teams to work faster
                & more efficiently.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">People seek convenience, and brands that offer this will be more appealing to them
                than any alternatives. Being able to adapt to changing needs, remaining a convenient choice for
                individuals to engage with, is the core goal of creating a scalable brand.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This engagement differs depending on the brand and stakeholders, but is ultimately
                required for brands to become & remain successful.</p>

                Every brand is different, and knowing the context of your brand helps understand what actions will have the most or least impact on your success.

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Additional comments and recommendations</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">For most brands, less is more. Not every organization requires copious documentation
                on how to use their assets or adhere to their messaging strategies. Many brands benefit from having
                fewer elements.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This is because complex brands require greater effort and coordination to enact
                changes than simpler brands.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">It's important to consider complexity when approaching brand scalability, evaluating
                the capabilities of an organization when determining what type of elements may be required.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Brand designers may be asked to provide additional assets that aren't necessarily
                valuable from the perspective of scalability. These designers should carefully assess how these requests
                affect the complexity of a brand, and may instead recommend improving existing assets as a more
                efficient solution.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">There is a constant balancing act within every brand to grow & adapt, while avoiding
                a burdening experience of managing a complex brand structure. Navigating this requires brand designers
                to be mindful of the practical aspects of their work, knowing that brands are fundamentally rooted in
                people helping people.</p>
