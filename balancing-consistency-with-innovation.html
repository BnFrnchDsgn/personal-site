        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">A tricky balancing situation</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Designers often look for innovative ways of approaching problems, using creativity
                to find more efficient solutions than traditional options. As technology and society change, there is a
                constant need for UX designers looking for these new opportunities.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">However, sometimes these solutions conflict with what users expect based on existing
                systems. These scenarios involve inconsistencies between what the user knows and what the designer is
                proposing.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Despite what may appear as simply failing to meet user expectations, these solutions
                are almost always designed to make the user's life easier by introducing new, beneficial concepts.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">Take for example, transit users may be used to visiting a ticket vendor
                location in
                order to buy tickets — only to learn that tickets will be moving to a digital-only model in the future.
                This poses numerous questions to users, such as "how do I buy my tickets?", "do I need to use a
                desktop?" and "do I need to create a transit account?". The transition to a digital model is intended to
                make taking transit easier than before, but tensions begin to mount as user uncertainty leads to
                significant support calls & inquiries.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">When situations, such as the previous example, call for significant innovation — UX
                designers must balance consistency with innovation. This task is inherently complex due to the polar
                differences between both directions.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Designers must consider how they will approach these situations, and how they will
                best serve their users with minimal uncertainty between what is provided and what is expected.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">To help understand the techniques that can be used to solve these challenges,
                designers can work to better understand the value of both consistency and innovation in their design
                decisions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

                Users will notice changes to processes their familiar with, and will be on the lookout for more changes—potentially slowing down their task speed after changes are implemented.

    <div class="sectionLearnEntry">
        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Defining consistency and innovation</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Both consistency and innovation are directional factors that guide designers towards
                solving existing user problems. Where consistency represents more traditional methods, innovation
                features new & unique methods. Since both directions solve user issues there is often some level of
                uncertainty in which should be used.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">To highlight the differences, UX designers should consider several important design
                variables that should influence their design choices: change, practicality, and risk.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Each of these variables represents a set of design considerations that help
                determine where to innovate and keep consistent. They serve as a tool to UX designers, simplifying this
                decision making process.</p>
            <ol class="scrollEaseIn">
                <li>Change refers to the technological or socio-economic advances that expand the
                    list of possible solutions. This involves considering what is and what will be available to users.
                </li>
                <li>Practicality involves assessing the pragmatic differences between options,
                    evaluating how these differences affect users — if at all.</li>
                <li>Risk is the understanding of the possible consequences if a design decision fails
                    to solve the problem it was intended for.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Whether a UX designer proposes a more consistent or innovative choice, that decision
                should be supported by an assessment of these considerations.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">It is also important to understand that inconsistent choices are not necessarily
                innovative and vice versa. With both design directions, UX designers should always strive to ensure some
                level of consistency across their design systems.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">With these considerations in mind, UX designers should be equipped to best evaluate
                if they should take a more consistent or innovative approach to the issue, activity, or product they are
                designing for.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

                Some user experiences are safer to experiment with than others, such as a self-checkout in a grocery store.

    <div class="sectionLearnEntry">
        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Approaching user issues</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">A common UX designer assignment is creating solutions for user issues as they arise.
                These could be frustrations, obstacles, or even barriers-of-entry within an overarching user journey. By
                solving the issue, the UX designer hopes to help the user achieve their goals.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">In many of these situations, issues arise as a result of a more traditional solution
                failing to meet user needs due to changes made along the journey or in a connected system.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">For example, a real estate platform implements changes that allow their
                realtors to
                upload more types of visual media as part of the listings. Users are then able to view images, 3D
                models, videos, and more within a gallery originally designed for just images. However, users voice
                frustration as the layout of the gallery makes it difficult to view these new types of media, many of
                whom get frustrated with using the default gallery controls and the added loading times. For the design
                team working on the platform, they are tasked with determining how to best display these new types of
                media for their users to minimize these frustrations.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Regardless of the solution used, the presentation of it should be consistent with
                other design choices within the journey. This level of consistency is implied, and should exist to
                ensure the overall experience appears logical for users.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">However, there may be ways of incorporating some form of innovation within the
                solution, which adds additional benefits to the user beyond simply solving the issue.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">Continuing the previous example, the design team believes that the best
                solution for
                the gallery usability issue is to develop a new, unique gallery with additional functionality for mixed
                media. This gallery will feature a variety of controls that help with displaying video, interacting with
                3D models, and browsing through images. In keeping with the consistency of the visual design system used
                on the platform, all of the UI for the new gallery will adhere to preset standards. This solution was
                selected over the more traditional approach of splitting the media up across a webpage in multiple
                sections that have their own media-specific controls.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">When considering the solution proposed in this example, the variables discussed
                earlier can be applied to the approach taken.</p>
            <ol class="scrollEaseIn">
                <li>Changes in supported media types means that users will have new ways of
                    interacting with the content uploaded by realtors on the platform.</li>
                <li>Combining the media into one section reduces the amount of time users will spend
                    scrolling up and down the page searching for this content.</li>
                <li>Using consistent UI minimizes the risk that users will fail with using the
                    gallery, because they will have experience using similar UI on other areas of the platform.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Resolving issues requires UX designers to consider the frustrations and obstacles
                facing users. This user-centric mindset makes it possible to evaluate where some level of innovation
                might be required beyond implementing a more traditional solution.</p>

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Improving user activities</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Successful user journeys are largely composed of well-thought and implemented flows
                that users complete as activities. Whether users are uploading a file or navigating a physical space,
                activities require time & awareness by the user in order to complete properly.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Even when there aren't any apparent issues affecting users, there can be
                opportunities to improve upon existing activities to improve the overall user experience.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">These types of opportunities involve modifying how activities are structured for
                users, identifying steps that could be refined, combined, or even removed. Knowing how to improve steps
                requires the consideration of consistency and innovation variables.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">As an example, a design team for an airport believes that travelers are
                taking
                longer than expected to read & comprehend the wayfinding signage setup through the airport. Despite
                there being no indication that travelers are frustrated or are late for their trips, the designers
                believe there is room for improvement. They are motivated to continually improve wayfinding experiences,
                as even marginal reductions in comprehension times can significantly reduce congestion throughout the
                airport. One idea involves a significant change in how signage is positioned, which involves moving
                overhead signage to digital vertical-displays that are placed along walking paths.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">In this example, there is no clear indication that an issue is present or immediate
                action is needed. However, the design team strives to act proactively, and uses this opportunity to
                improve upon a part of the user journey for their airport travelers.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">The proposed idea involves significantly revisiting the wayfinding approach, as a
                way of innovating the more traditional, consistent signage into a new experience. To help make sense of
                the possible effects in pursuing this direction, the design team considers the following variables:</p>
            <ol class="scrollEaseIn">
                <li>New digital display technology allows for increased flexibility in updating
                    signage remotely, which could be used for new types of notices & announcements.</li>
                <li>Travelers should be able to access the same information in the new display
                    format, although they may not initially recognize it as a permanent replacement to the traditional
                    overhead signage.</li>
                <li>If this new wayfinding approach causes confusion, it could create massive issues
                    with travelers being unable to navigate through the airport — through congestion, missed flights,
                    and
                    frustration.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">Continuing this example, the design team deliberates on whether to
                pursue this new,
                innovative approach or look for ways of modifying their existing approach. They decide that although the
                aspects of change and practicality seem to allow for innovation, the amount of risk is too substantial.
                The design team determines that there may be room for adding upon their wayfinding with new types of
                digital displays, but moves to implement changes more consistent with traditional airport wayfinding
                approaches.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">When striving to improve upon an activity for users, UX designers should be aware
                that the primary focus should be on preserving the lack of issues for users. Even when there is room for
                improvement, the potential of causing new issues should incentivize designers to act very carefully.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This carefulness should not always be associated with finding safe solutions that
                focus on consistent methodologies. In many situations, incorporating innovative changes can actually
                create new opportunities to improve other, related activities by using a similar approach. In these
                scenarios, the innovative approach gradually shifts to becoming the traditional approach.</p>

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Designing new products</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Products solve issues for their users, and the value they provide is largely
                influenced by how usable they are by the intended users. The direct relationship between value and
                usability incentivizes UX designers to make the products as usable as possible, which then improves the
                value it provides.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Naturally, many UX designers will start with finding ways of creating products that
                are consistent with similar, existing products. The notion being that users will have an easier time
                using a product if they can draw upon experience of using something similar.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Although this approach works in the majority of scenarios, there are often
                opportunities to implement an innovative product that solves more issues than was originally needed.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">For example, a design team is tasked with creating a USB charging port
                as part of a
                larger campaign to develop an ecosystem of workspace equipment. The designers are well aware that these
                devices exist across nearly every modern office environment, and their users are more than familiar with
                how to set them up. However, the design team considers introducing a more innovative approach that
                involves using modular parts that can be swapped interchangeably. The proposed idea would open up new
                opportunities to users, allowing them to create any type of charging port needed without having to
                purchase preset port designs.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">The proposed design in this example is intended to empower users by enabling them to
                find & solve a variety of issues. Users could create more elaborate charging stations, take individual
                parts on business trips, and make more efficient purchases by buying individual components.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Despite these interesting opportunities for users, this approach introduces new
                complexities for users as they must now learn how they should best use this product. The fundamental
                application may not have changed, but users are now expected to think differently about how they should
                set up their charging stations.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Considering this added complexity, the design team discusses several variables:</p>
            <ol class="scrollEaseIn">
                <li>New engineering technologies allow for this type of modular approach, allowing
                    users to use more freeform product designs compared to static designs.</li>
                <li>Users would be able to charge their devices as needed, regardless of the design
                    approach taken.</li>
                <li>The added complexity with a modular design might turn off prospective users from
                    wanting to try this product.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">Continuing this example, the design determines that the best approach
                will be to use
                a combination of consistency and innovation. A modular approach will be used, but the products will be
                largely packaged in preset layouts. This would allow users to easily begin using the product without
                needing to use the modular features, while offering more freedom to those who benefit from those
                features.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">In many product design situations, a hybrid approach represents the best of both
                consistency and innovation. Allowing users to quickly embrace a new product then makes it more likely
                that they will try the innovative qualities added into the product.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Regardless of if a product design follows a more traditional design or not, UX
                designers are primarily focused with creating products that provide the most value to their users.</p>

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Finding the right balance</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">All great UX design decisions incorporate some level of consistency. Meaning that
                users are able to recognize patterns and similarities to other similar designs, making it easier to
                engage with the design than with designs that are entirely unique.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">As changes emerge in the lives of users, the need for revisiting traditional
                approaches will require UX designers to find innovative solutions.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Understandably, innovation takes away from some of the consistency users expect by
                providing them with a new way of thinking. This change can be complex, requiring users to learn new
                skills & knowledge with the ideal potential of being more successful in their goals.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This relationship between consistency and innovation is a constant challenge of
                balancing both approaches with each design solution. Too much of either, and users may not get the full
                benefit of what could be available to them.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">To gain a starting point in determining where to consider innovating, UX designers
                are encouraged to consider change, practicality, and risk.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Each of these variables can identify problems that might arise from pursuing too
                much innovation. Simultaneously, these variables can highlight opportunities to provide more value to
                users than was previously thought to be possible.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Regardless of the final solution used by the UX designer, it should reflect a
                careful consideration of how their decisions will affect the user. This mindfulness of user needs will
                naturally lead to creating better design solutions, helping users become more successful.</p>

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Additional comments and recommendations</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Many businesses and organizations will champion innovative thinking, often to an
                excessive degree. Innovation is an appealing concept, because it alludes to unknown benefits that could
                make significant improvements in user experiences.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">However, innovation is also commonly associated with failure. Many unique ideas are
                proposed each day by designers that will ultimately fail, because they feature overly innovative
                features that don't contribute value to the user.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This is where the consideration of variables between consistency and innovation
                becomes paramount.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Understanding how an innovative approach might affect users is how UX designers can
                predict the success of their creative thinking. Without these considerations, UX designers rely on
                assumptions to guide their decisions — which might not be correct.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">The fundamental challenge then becomes a matter of dealing with the pressure to be
                innovative, even when it might not be necessary. For UX designers, this pressure complicates the design
                decision process of knowing what users need to be successful.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">An organization may incentivize creating something new each time, making designers
                tread carefully about how consistent their designs are over time. Alternatively, a business may demand
                frequent innovation to remain competitive — instead of pursuing increased value to users over time.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Balancing consistency and innovation is a challenge without these contexts. For UX
                designers, accounting for these pressures is enormously helpful when recommending & asserting the most
                effective design decisions.</p>
