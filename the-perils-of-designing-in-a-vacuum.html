            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Designing with 'context' in mind</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">At the root of all UX projects are goals centered around improving a user's
                experience. However, accomplishing this naturally involves accounting for a multitude of factors.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">What are the users trying to accomplish? What are their motivations? What skills and
                knowledge do they likely possess?</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">In UX design, most of factors being considered have to do with the users themselves.
                Other factors typically involve the resources and tools available to deliver an intended experience for
                users.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">All of these factors amount to the 'context' of a UX project.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">When solutions are implemented without this consideration, they have been designed
                in a 'vacuum'. These solutions typically fail to deliver on the intended value, because they lack
                relevancy to what users expect or need.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Depending on the situation, there can be significant consequences for UX projects
                that fail to solve an issue. As a result, users may fail what they need to accomplish, and they will be
                the direct recipients of any ensuing consequences.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">These types of situations are entirely avoidable, and UX designers should always use
                strategies that stop them from designing in vacuums.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sectionLearnEntry">
        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">How designers get sucked into a vacuum</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Despite how incorporating context into a design may seem intuitive, it is just as
                easy to lose sight of relevant factors when working on a UX project.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This is because UX designers will subconsciously include their own bias into design
                decisions & plannings.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">In most situations, this actually serves a very beneficial purpose — it helps the UX
                designer empathize with their users without thinking. They understand what makes an effective design,
                and will make design decisions that are based on UX principles.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">But, what can easily happen is an over reliance on these assumptions, which might
                not be correct based on one or more factors. This possibility encourages UX designers to find a balance
                between making decisions based on what they know and don't know (yet).</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Staying out of a vacuum requires some level of research or analysis by the UX
                designer. This assessment creates a sense of understanding on knowing which assumptions may be
                ineffective at solving the issues users are encountering.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Gaining this contextual understanding can be done through several types of
                assessments by a UX designer.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sectionLearnEntry">
        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Creating user profiles</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">One of the most common methods UX designers use to learn more about their users — is
                to create profiles. These are categories of users organized together based on shared motivations,
                characteristics, and capabilities.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Profiles provide a summarization of what some users will expect, acting as a
                valuable reference for UX designers in assessing their own assumptions.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">For example, a UX designer working on the design of a physical product
                would likely
                want to include a profile for users that have certain physical disabilities. These users will have very
                different needs than those who can use the product without any limitation. These differences provide
                reference points for the UX designer to compare what they had originally planned for against what this
                type of user will look for in how the product is designed.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Creating user profiles can be done through a variety of different tools, approaches,
                and styles. However, all user profiles share the similarity of including relevant information for a
                particular UX project.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">User profiles are expected to differ from project to project, because there will be
                different intended outcomes & requirements that the profile is intended to help account for.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This is why UX designers are encouraged to always start with considering what user
                information would be relevant to look for based on how their project is structured. These considerations
                also help the UX designer avoid accidently using irrelevant information, further prioritizing the most
                effective solutions.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">To efficiently identify what will be relevant to know, UX designers can work
                backwards from the intended outcomes.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">As an example, if a key outcome is improved user satisfaction, then a UX designer
                would look at the factors that affect satisfaction. This could include considering user time management
                & emotions. Variables in a user profile for 'emotions' might include an expectation on the users
                feelings at the start of their user journey. This can then be researched further if needed, before being
                a comparison point between the start and end of a user journey.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Even when a user profile relies on one or more assumptions, it's important for UX
                designers to carefully consider how they reached that consensus. Looking at factors affecting users can
                support safe assumptions about user motivations, feelings, and abilities.</p>

        <div class="entryDescription">
            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Creating project maintenance plans</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Determining the 'best' solution for a UX problem requires understanding the
                relationship between available resources and potential options. This is a contextual consideration that
                focuses on the practicality of a solution over a period of time.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Not every solution is intended to be permanent, but solutions are much more
                effective at improving an overall user experience if they provide a consistent, positive experience over
                time.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">As an example, a UX designer proposes to a business that they should
                invest in a
                mobile app to help customers place orders more efficiently. Research for the plan indicates the business
                would expect to see a rapid increase in customer satisfaction, leading to a boost in monthly sales.
                However, these plans don't necessary include the time needed by the business to manage & maintain the
                data being used on the app that customers will be using. Internal reviews of the plan reveal that
                although there will be numerous UX improvements for customer journeys, the business is not expected to
                have enough staff available to manage the app effectively.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">For UX designers, not having all of the information needed to know what is possible
                is expected at the start of any project. This is a reality that encourages UX designers to either
                research or work with a researcher to determine what resources are available.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Resources is a broad concept, but typically concerns the time, expenses, and
                knowledge a team can invest in a possible solution.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Each of these factors affects how viable a potential solution is for a UX problem,
                and lacking one or more required resource can significantly reduce its effectiveness. The opposite is
                also true, that having an abundance of resources indicates potential solutions should be easily
                maintainable over time.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This context is key to effective maintenance planning — that it demonstrates the UX
                designer is accounting for the practicality of possible solutions.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Every maintained plan will differ depending on the nature of the UX situation. Some
                plans will focus on managing consistent communication towards users, while others will be focused on
                making consistent design choices.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">A similarity across all of these plans is that they combine context with
                consistency. This direction explains how users can expect the same positive results over time without
                the concern of these results being impossible to maintain.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">When UX problems appear to have been solved indefinitely, UX designers can
                confidently move onto other pressing challenges to continue this cycle of positive improvements.</p>

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Creating engagement spaces</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Many relevant factors for a UX project will change over time. Sometimes these
                changes are insignificant, but in some scenarios they require UX designers to use new information in
                directing new & existing solutions.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Instead of spending time and effort constantly searching for potential changes, UX
                designers will typically invest in creating an 'engagement space'. These are channels that stakeholders
                in a UX project can use to share their feedback as a method of tracking changes in their experiences
                over time.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn learnExample">For example, many UX designers will work on collecting basic
                satisfaction metrics
                from users at the end of important user flows. This could be an online order, visit to a location, or
                even reading an article. Regardless of the situation, the purpose is to create a tool that provides
                passive stakeholder feedback that can be reviewed periodically for potential improvements in the overall
                UX approach being taken. Users of an online store might start to share increasingly negative feedback
                that would inspire the business to begin investigating possible causes & solutions to the situation.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">These feedback channels are commonly used after the implementation of a solution,
                but can just as effectively be used during a project. Feedback on how a plan is progressing or getting
                comments on a prototype are traditional examples of using engagement to direct how a solution is
                eventually implemented.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Engagement spaces also serve as checks for a UX designer when reviewing their own
                understanding of contextual factors.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">A UX designer may be confident in understanding the target users and available
                resources, but the research supporting that understanding might be flawed due to its source. Engagement
                spaces are direct channels for stakeholders to share what they're thinking with UX designers, providing
                an opportunity to compare existing research with these responses.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">When designing these channels, UX designers are always encouraged to consider what
                type of feedback is relevant to improving their understanding of the context. A lack of prompt towards
                the stakeholder can open up responses to being problematically varied, making an analysis of the
                response more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">By find ways to collect regular, useful feedback — UX designers can keep themselves
                well-informed of important project factors that need to be accounted for when finding effective UX
                solutions.</p>

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">The dangers of the vacuum</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Context fundamentally provides a tool for UX designers to minimize confusion &
                frustration with a project. It helps account for relevant factors that determine how successful possible
                solutions will be, while helping avoid creating new issues.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">These dangers involve using inaccurate information to guide important UX decision
                mistaking, potentially leading to new challenges for users.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">A common vacuum scenario is when UX designers used outdated research that doesn't
                account for current user expectations. This could involve users not knowing how to complete tasks or
                find information, because they rely on a different understanding of the situation than what the UX
                designer has envisioned. The consequences for users can appear quickly, leading to rapid decline in the
                quality of the overall user experience. Minimizing the likelihood of these situations is critical in
                maintain a positive trajectory for user experiences.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">For these reasons, context is often treated as a prediction tool. Factors
                surrounding a situation are indications of what effects can be expected when change is introduced into a
                system.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Disregarding contextual factors blurs the distinction between what is expected to be
                an effective solution and what could pose as a challenge to users.</p>

                It's always easier to stay out of a vacuum than to get yourself back into the reality of a project after you've found yourself isolated from context.

            <h2 class="scrollEaseIn">Additional comments and recommendations</h2>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Many UX designers and teams work in fast-paced environments, where there is an
                underlying pressure to implement solutions as quickly as possible. These situations naturally
                incentivize UX designers to increase their reliance on existing knowledge to speed up their workflows.
            </p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Despite the immediate benefit of feeling 'at pace', this response to organizational
                pressures often results with a decline in solution quality. Not taking adequate time to review the
                context of a situation will increase the possibility of solutions failing to deliver value for users.
            </p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">This conflict is made worse by the gratification of delivering solutions on time,
                further promoting the notion that how work is being done aligns with what is required.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">However, this requirement is intended to be balanced alongside the fundamental
                pursuits of UX design — to provide users with a better experience.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">An effective approach of balancing these management needs is looking for the most
                efficient ways of gaining & maintaining contextual understanding. Some methods, like a research study,
                might not be easily achievable when time restrictions prohibit extensive assessments.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Because of these pressures, UX designers are encouraged to focus on the context of
                their work environment. Actively looking for ways of staying informed on UX assignments is a mindset
                that rewards UX designers with having an easier time achieving success with their solutions.</p>
            <p class="scrollEaseIn">Feeling overconfident or overwhelmed is itself a variable that UX designers can use
                to help guide them towards being as successful as possible in their professional pursuits.</p>
